# Clockwork

## About the Engine 

This is a reupload of my old C++/Opengl/GLFW3 game engine from early 2018. 

It contains a basic chunk system, state management, camera movement, textures and cube entity models. 

But this is not a finished project. Many parts are buggy, work in progress, or abandoned.

## Using the Test exe 

- You can also download the test binaries directly without the source code from https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/Nikoo00o/Clockwork/tree/main/binaries

- After starting Clockwork_Core.exe you can move around with aswd and ctrl/spacebar. You can also zoom in/out by changing the fov via scrolling the mouse wheel. 

- As long as the player is alive, moving blocks will spawn which kill the player on collision. This can be reset by pressing p. 

- Solid blocks will have collision as long as they are not rotated with the arrow keys. 

- After clicking the middle mouse button, you can spawn transparent cubes with leftclick and remove them with rightclick.
